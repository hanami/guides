title: "Building a web app"
order: 20
---

Now that we've [created our app](/v2.2/introduction/getting-started/), let's turn it into a web app.

## Adding our first functionality

Let's take a look at Hanami by creating the beginnings of a bookshelf app.

In the file `spec/requests/root_spec.rb`, Hanami provides a request spec confirming the absence of a defined root page (which is why the welcome screen shows instead).

```ruby
# spec/requests/root_spec.rb

RSpec.describe "Root", type: :request do
  it "is not found" do
    get "/"

    # Generate new action via:
    #   `bundle exec hanami generate action home.index --url=/`
    expect(last_response.status).to be(404)
  end
end
```

We can run that spec now to prove that it works:

```shell
$ bundle exec rspec spec/requests/root_spec.rb
```

You should see:

```shell
Root
  is not found

1 example, 0 failures
```

Let's change this to expect a page showing "Welcome to Bookshelf". First, we'll adjust our spec:

```ruby
# spec/requests/root_spec.rb

RSpec.describe "Root", type: :request do
  it "is successful" do
    get "/"

    expect(last_response.body).to include "Welcome to Bookshelf"
    expect(last_response).to be_successful
  end
end
```

As we expect, when we run the spec again, it fails:

```shell
$ bundle exec rspec spec/requests/root_spec.rb

Root
  is successful (FAILED - 1)

Failures:

  1) Root is successful
     Failure/Error: expect(last_response.body).to include "Welcome to Bookshelf"
       expected "Not Found" to include "Welcome to Bookshelf"

1 example, 1 failure
```

To fix this, let's open our app's routes file at `config/routes.rb`:

```ruby
# config/routes.rb

module Bookshelf
  class Routes < Hanami::Routes
    # Add your routes here. See https://guides.hanamirb.org/routing/overview/ for details.
  end
end
```

This `Bookshelf::Routes` class contains the configuration for our app's router. Routes in Hanami are comprised of a HTTP method, a path, and an endpoint to be invoked, which is usually a Hanami action. (See the [Routing guide](/v2.2/routing/overview/) for more information).

To help make our spec pass, let's add a route to invoke a new action.

```ruby
# config/routes.rb

module Bookshelf
  class Routes < Hanami::Routes
    root to: "home.index"
  end
end
```

If we run our test again, we'll see a `Hanami::Routes::MissingActionError`:

```shell
$ bundle exec rspec spec/requests/root_spec.rb

Failures:

  1) Root is successful
     Failure/Error: get "/"

     Hanami::Routes::MissingActionError:
       Could not find action with key "actions.home.index" in Bookshelf::App

       To fix this, define the action class Bookshelf::Actions::Home::Index in /Users/jane/bookshelf/actions/home/index.rb

1 example, 1 failure
```

As this error suggests, we need to create the home show action the route is expecting to be able to call.

Hanami provides an action generator we can use to create this action. Running this command will create the home show action:

```shell
$ bundle exec hanami generate action home.index --skip-route --skip-tests
```

We can find this action in our `app` directory at `app/actions/home/index.rb`:

```ruby
# app/actions/home/index.rb

module Bookshelf
  module Actions
    module Home
      class Index < Bookshelf::Action
        def handle(request, response)
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

In a Hanami app, every action is an individual class. Actions decide what HTTP response (body, headers and status code) to return for a given request.

Actions define a `#handle` method that accepts a `request` object, representing the incoming request, and a `response` object, representing the outgoing response.

```ruby
def handle(request, response)
  # ...
end
```

For more details on actions, see the [Actions guide](/v2.2/actions/overview/).

By default, an action will render its equivalent view. We can find our new view in our `app` directory at `app/views/home/index.rb`:

```ruby
# app/views/home/index.rb

module Bookshelf
  module Views
    module Home
      class Index < Bookshelf::View
      end
    end
  end
end
```

Just like actions, every view in a Hanami app is an individual class. Views prepare the values to be passed to a template, then render that template to generate their output.

We can find this view's template in our `app` directory at `app/templates/home/index.html.erb`. Let's adjust this template to include our desired "Welcome to Bookshelf" text.

```sql
# app/templates/home/index.html.erb

<h1>Welcome to Bookshelf</h1>
```

At this point we need to compile our frontend assets just once, so they're available to the layout in `app/views/layouts/app.html.erb`:

```shell
$ bundle exec hanami assets compile
```

After this, our root spec will now pass!

```shell
$ bundle exec rspec spec/requests/root_spec.rb

Root
  is successful

1 example, 0 failures
```

Request specs like these are suitable for testing API endpoints, but since we'll be creating HTML pages in our app, we'll want a more appropriate testing tool. For this, we'll use [Capybara](https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara) feature specs.

Delete the `spec/requests/root_spec.rb` and replace it with a Capybara-driven test at `spec/features/home_spec.rb`:

```ruby
RSpec.feature "Home" do
  scenario "visiting the home page shows a welcome message" do
    visit "/"

    expect(page).to have_content "Welcome to Bookshelf"
  end
end
```

This new test should also pass:

```shell
$ bundle exec rspec spec/features/home_spec.rb

Home
  visiting the home page shows a welcome message

1 example, 0 failures
```

## Adding a new route and action

As the next step in our bookshelf project, let's add the ability to show an index of all books in the system.

First we'll create a request spec for listing books that expects a successful response, listing two books:

```ruby
# spec/features/books/index_spec.rb

RSpec.feature "Books index" do
  it "shows a list of books" do
    visit "/books"

    expect(page).to have_selector "li", text: "Test Driven Development"
    expect(page).to have_selector "li", text: "Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby"
  end
end
```

If you run this test, you'll see that it fails because the page doesn't have the expected content. This is because our app currently returns a 404 error page for the `/books` route:

```shell
$ bundle exec rspec spec/features/books/index_spec.rb

Books index
  shows a list of books (FAILED - 1)

Failures:

  1) Books index shows a list of books
     Failure/Error: expect(page).to have_selector "li", text: "Test Driven Development"
       expected to find css "li" but there were no matches
     # ./spec/features/books/index_spec.rb:5:in `block (2 levels) in <top (required)>'

Finished in 0.09789 seconds (files took 0.57724 seconds to load)
1 example, 1 failure
```

Let's fix that by generating an action for a books index:

```shell
$ bundle exec hanami generate action books.index --skip-tests
```

In addition to generating an action at `app/actions/books/index.rb` and a view at `app/views/books/index.rb`, the generator has also added a route in `config/routes.rb`:

```ruby
module Bookshelf
  class Routes < Hanami::Routes
    root to: "home.index"
    get "/books", to: "books.index"
  end
end
```

Let's update our view to provide the books to our template:

```ruby
# app/views/books/index.rb

module Bookshelf
  module Views
    module Books
      class Index < Bookshelf::View
        expose :books do
          [
            {title: "Test Driven Development"},
            {title: "Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby"}
          ]
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

Then we can update our template to present the books:

```sql
<!-- app/templates/books/index.html.erb -->

<h1>Books</h1>

<ul>
  <% books.each do |book| %>
    <li><%= book[:title] %></li>
  <% end %>
</ul>
```

If we run our spec, it now passes:

```shell
$ bundle exec rspec spec/features/books/index_spec.rb

Books index
  shows a list of books

1 example, 0 failures
```

## Listing books from a database

Of course, returning a static list of books is not particularly useful. Let's address this by retrieving books from a database.

### Preparing a books table

To create a books table, we need to generate a migration:

```shell
$ bundle exec hanami generate migration create_books
```

Edit the migration file to create a books table with title and author columns and a primary key:

```ruby
# config/db/migrate/20221113050928_create_books.rb

ROM::SQL.migration do
  change do
    create_table :books do
      primary_key :id
      column :title, :text, null: false
      column :author, :text, null: false
    end
  end
end
```

Migrate the development and test databases:

```shell
$ bundle exec hanami db migrate
```

Next, let's generate a relation to allow our app to interact with our books table. To generate a relation:

```shell
$ bundle exec hanami generate relation books
```

This creates the following file at `app/relations/books.rb`:

```ruby
# lib/bookshelf/persistence/relations/books.rb

module Bookshelf
  module Relations
    class Books < Bookshelf::DB::Relation
      schema :books, infer: true
    end
  end
end
```

### Updating our test

Now we can go ahead adapt our books index spec to expect an index of books from a database, with authors included alongside titles. We can use the books relation to insert the records.

```ruby
# spec/features/books/index_spec.rb

RSpec.feature "Books index" do
  let(:books) { Hanami.app["relations.books"] }

  before do
    books.insert(title: "Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby", author: "Sandi Metz")
    books.insert(title: "Test Driven Development", author: "Kent Beck")
  end

  it "shows a list of books" do
    visit "/books"

    expect(page).to have_selector "li", text: "Test Driven Development, by Kent Beck"
    expect(page).to have_selector "li", text: "Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby, by Sandi Metz"
  end
end
```

To get this spec to pass, we'll need to update our books index view to retrieve books from our database. For this we can generate a book repo:

```shell
$ bundle exec hanami generate repo book
```

Repos serve as the interface to our persisted data from our domain layer. Let's edit the repo to add a method that returns all books ordered by title:

```ruby
# app/repos/book_repo.rb

module Bookshelf
  module Repos
    class BookRepo < Bookshelf::DB::Repo
      def all_by_title
        books.order(books[:title].asc).to_a
      end
    end
  end
end
```

To access this book repo from the view, we can use Hanami's Deps mixin. Covered in detail in the [container and components](/v2.2/app/container-and-components/) section of the Architecture guide, the Deps mixin gives each of your app's components easy access to the other components it depends on to achieve its work. We'll see this in more detail as these guides progress.

For now however, it's enough to know that we can use `include Deps["repos.book_repo"]` to make the repo available via a `book_repo` method within our view.

We can now call this repo from our exposure:

```ruby
# app/views/books/index.rb

module Bookshelf
  module Views
    module Books
      class Index < Bookshelf::View
        include Deps["repos.book_repo"]

        expose :books do
          book_repo.all_by_title
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

Then we can update our template to include the author:

```sql
<!-- app/templates/books/index.html.erb -->

<h1>Books</h1>

<ul>
  <% books.each do |book| %>
    <li><%= book[:title] %>, by <%= book[:author] %></li>
  <% end %>
</ul>
```

With this action in place, the spec passes once more:

```shell
$ bundle exec rspec spec/features/books/index_spec.rb

Books index
  shows a list of books

1 example, 0 failures
```

## Using request parameters

Of course, returning _every_ book in the database when a visitor makes a request to `/books` is not going to be a good strategy for very long. Luckily, relations offer pagination support. Let's add pagination with a default page size of 5:

```ruby
# app/relations/books.rb

module Bookshelf
  module Relations
    class Books < Bookshelf::DB::Relation
      schema :books, infer: true

      use :pagination
      per_page 5
    end
  end
end
```

This will enable our books index to vary based on `page` and `per_page` params.

Let's add a request spec verifying pagination:

```ruby
# spec/features/books/index/pagination_spec.rb

RSpec.feature "Books index pagination" do
  let(:books) { Hanami.app["relations.books"] }

  before do
    10.times do |n|
      books.insert(title: "Book #{n}", author: "Author #{n}")
    end
  end

  it "returns the correct page of books" do
    visit "/books?page=1&per_page=3"

    expect(page).to have_selector "li", count: 3
    expect(page.find("li:nth-child(1)")).to have_content "Book 0, by Author 0"
    expect(page.find("li:nth-child(2)")).to have_content "Book 1, by Author 1"
    expect(page.find("li:nth-child(3)")).to have_content "Book 2, by Author 2"
  end
end
```

In our index action, we can use the request object to extract the relevant params from the incoming request, and then pass them as inputs to its view:

```ruby
# app/actions/books/index.rb

module Bookshelf
  module Actions
    module Books
      class Index < Bookshelf::Action
        def handle(request, response)
          response.render(
            view,
            page: request.params[:page] || 1,
            per_page: request.params[:per_page] || 5
          )
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

In the view, we can update our books exposure to take these inputs and pass them to the repo method:

```ruby
# app/views/books/index.rb

module Bookshelf
  module Views
    module Books
      class Index < Bookshelf::View
        include Deps["repos.book_repo"]

        expose :books do |page:, per_page:|
          book_repo.all_by_title(page:, per_page:)
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

And in the repo, we can use these to control the pagination:

```ruby
# app/repos/book_repo.rb

module Bookshelf
  module Repos
    class BookRepo < Bookshelf::Repo
      def all_by_title(page:, per_page:)
        books
          .order(books[:title].asc)
          .page(page)
          .per_page(per_page)
          .to_a
      end
    end
  end
end
```

This alows our spec to pass!

```shell
$ bundle exec rspec spec/features/books/index/pagination_spec.rb

Books index pagination
  returns the correct page of books

1 example, 0 failures
```

## Showing a book

In addition to our books index, we also want to provide an endpoint for viewing the details of a particular book.

Let's specify a `/books/:id` request that renders a book for a given ID, or returns 404 if there's no book for with the ID.

```ruby
# spec/features/books/show_spec.rb

RSpec.feature "Showing a book" do
  let(:books) { Hanami.app["relations.books"] }

  context "when a book matches the given ID" do
    let!(:book_id) do
      books.insert(title: "Test Driven Development", author: "Kent Beck")
    end

    it "shows the book" do
      visit "/books/#{book_id}"

      expect(page).to have_content "Test Driven Development"
      expect(page).to have_content "Kent Beck"
    end
  end

  context "when no book matches the given ID" do
    it "returns not found" do
      visit "/books/#{books.max(:id).to_i + 1}"

      expect(page.status_code).to eq 404
    end
  end
end
```

Because there's no matching route yet, the “happy path” side of this spec immediately fails.

```shell
$ bundle exec rspec spec/features/books/show_spec.rb

Showing a book
  when no book matches the given ID
    returns not found
  when a book matches the given ID
    shows the book (FAILED - 1)

Failures:

  1) Showing a book when a book matches the given ID shows the book
     Failure/Error: expect(page).to have_content "Test Driven Development"
       expected to find text "Test Driven Development" in "Not Found"
     # ./spec/features/books/show_spec.rb:12:in `block (3 levels) in <top (required)>'

2 examples, 1 failure
```

We can use Hanami's action generator to create both a route and an action. Run:

```shell
$ bundle exec hanami generate action books.show --skip-tests
```

If you inspect `config/routes.rb` you will see the generator has automatically added a new `get "/books/:id", to: "books.show"` route:

```ruby
# config/routes.rb

module Bookshelf
  class Routes < Hanami::Routes
    root to: "home.index"
    get "/books", to: "books.index"
    get "/books/:id", to: "books.show"
  end
end
```

We can now edit the action at `app/actions/books/show.rb` to begin adding the required behaviour, passing the id param to its view.

```ruby
# app/actions/books/show.rb

module Bookshelf
  module Actions
    module Books
      class Show < Bookshelf::Action
        def handle(request, response)
          response.render(view, id: request.params[:id])
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

To fetch a single book from our database, we can add a new method to our book repo:

```ruby
# app/repos/book_repo.rb

module Bookshelf
  module Repos
    class BookRepo < Bookshelf::Repo
      def get(id)
        books.by_pk(id).one
      end
    end
  end
end
```

Then we can edit the view at `app/views/books/show.rb` to get the book via the repo and expose it to the template:

```ruby
# app/views/books/show.rb

module Bookshelf
  module Views
    module Books
      class Show < Bookshelf::View
        include Deps["repos.book_repo"]

        expose :book do |id:|
          book_repo.get(id)
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

Lastly, we can populate the template.

```sql
<!-- app/views/books/show.html.erb -->

<h1><%= book.title %></h1>

<p>By <%= book.author %></p>
```

With this, our happy path test passes, but the test for our 404 now fails:

```shell
$ bundle exec rspec spec/features/books/show_spec.rb

Showing a book
  when a book matches the given ID
    shows the book
  when no book matches the given ID
    returns not found (FAILED - 1)

Failures:

  1) Showing a book when no book matches the given ID returns not found
     Failure/Error: <h1><%= book[:title] %></h1>

     NoMethodError:
       undefined method `title' for nil
     # ./app/templates/books/show.html.erb:1:in `__tilt_8300'
     # ./app/actions/books/show.rb:8:in `handle'
     # ./spec/features/books/show_spec.rb:19:in `block (3 levels) in <top (required)>'

2 examples, 1 failure
```

This is because in our repo, we used the relation's `#one` method to return out book, which will return `nil` if there's no book with the requisite ID, leading to this "undefined method on NilClass" error from the template.

However, in addition to `#one`, relations also provide a `#one!` method, which instead raises a `ROM::TupleCountMismatchError` exception when no record is found.

Let's make that change in our repo now:

```ruby
# app/repos/book_repo.rb

def get(id)
  books.by_pk(id).one!
end
```

We can use this to handle 404s via Hanami's action exception handling: `handle_exception`, which takes the name of a method to invoke when a particular exception occurs.

Taking this approach allows our handle method to remain concerned only with the happy path:

```ruby
# app/actions/books/show.rb

require "rom"

module Bookshelf
  module Actions
    module Books
      class Show < Bookshelf::Action
        handle_exception ROM::TupleCountMismatchError => :handle_not_found

        def handle(request, response)
          response.render(view, id: request.params[:id])
        end

        private

        def handle_not_found(request, response, exception)
          response.status = 404
          response.format = :html
          response.body = "Not found"
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

With this, our spec fully passes:

```shell
$ bundle exec rspec spec/features/books/show_spec.rb

Showing a book
  when no book matches the given ID
    returns not found
  when a book matches the given ID
    shows the book

2 examples, 0 failures
```

This exception handling behavior can also be moved into the base `Bookshelf::Action` class at `app/action.rb`, meaning that any action inheriting from `Bookshelf::Action` will handle `ROM::TupleCountMismatchError` in the same way.

```ruby
# app/action.rb

require "rom"

module Bookshelf
  class Action < Hanami::Action
    # Provide `Success` and `Failure` for pattern matching on operation results
    include Dry::Monads[:result]

    handle_exception ROM::TupleCountMismatchError => :handle_not_found

    private

    def handle_not_found(request, response, exception)
      response.status = 404
      response.format = :html
      response.body = "Not found"
    end
  end
end
```

With its base action configured to handle `ROM::TupleCountMismatchError` exceptions, the `Books::Show` action can now be as follows and our spec continues to pass:

```ruby
# app/actions/books/show.rb

module Bookshelf
  module Actions
    module Books
      class Show < Bookshelf::Action
        def handle(request, response)
          response.render(view, id: request.params[:id])
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

## Creating a book

Now that our visitors can list and view books, let's allow them to create books too.

Here's a feature spec that fills in and submits a new book book form, and expects that only valid submissions result in a book being created:

```ruby
# spec/features/books/create_spec.rb

RSpec.feature "Creating books" do
  it "creates a book when given valid attributes" do
    visit "/books/new"

    fill_in "Title", with: "Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby"
    fill_in "Author", with: "Sandi Metz"
    click_on "Create"

    expect(page).to have_content "Book created"
    expect(page).to have_selector "h1", text: "Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby"
    expect(page).to have_selector "p", text: "Sandi Metz"
  end

  it "shows errors and does not create the book when given invalid attributes" do
    visit "/books/new"

    fill_in "Title", with: "Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby"
    click_on "Create"

    expect(page).to have_content "Could not create book"
    expect(page).to have_field "Title", with: "Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby"
    expect(page).to have_field "Author", with: ""
  end
end
```

Running this spec, we see failures due to the title field being missing. This is because we don't yet have the page to display a book form.

Hanami's action generator can take care of this for us:

```shell
$ bundle exec hanami generate action books.new --skip-tests
```

Let's also generate a matching create action:

```shell
$ bundle exec hanami generate action books.create --skip-tests
```

The app's routes now include the expected routes - invoking the `books.new` action for GET requests to `/books/new`, and the `books.create` action for `POST` requests to `/books`:

```ruby
module Bookshelf
  class Routes < Hanami::Routes
    root to: "home.show"
    get "/books", to: "books.index"
    get "/books/:id", to: "books.show"
    get "/books/new", to: "books.new"
    post "/books", to: "books.create"
  end
end
```

Let's add some name aliases to these routes so we can easily refer to them later:

```ruby
module Bookshelf
  class Routes < Hanami::Routes
    root to: "home.show"
    get "/books", to: "books.index"
    get "/books/:id", to: "books.show", as: :show_book
    get "/books/new", to: "books.new"
    post "/books", to: "books.create", as: :create_book
  end
end
```

To show a form for creating a new book, we don't need any special handling in either its action or view classes, so we can jump straight to the template:

```sql
<!-- app/templates/books/new.html.erb -->

<h1>New book</h1>

<%= form_for :book, routes.path(:create_book) do |f| %>
  <p>
    <%= f.label "Title", for: :title %>
    <%= f.text_field :title %>
  </p>
  <p>
    <%= f.label "Author", for: :author %>
    <%= f.text_field :author %>
  </p>
  <p>
    <%= f.submit "Create" %>
  </p>
<% end %>
```

At this point, running the test hints at our next step:

```shell
$ bundle exec rspec spec/features/books/create_spec.rb

Creating books
  creates a book when given valid attributes (FAILED - 1)
  shows errors and does not create the book when given invalid attributes (FAILED - 2)

Failures:

  1) Creating books creates a book when given valid attributes
     Failure/Error: expect(page).to have_content "Book created"
       expected to find text "Book created" in "New book\nTitle\nAuthor\nCreate"
     # ./spec/features/books/create_spec.rb:9:in `block (2 levels) in <top (required)>'

  2) Creating books shows errors and does not create the book when given invalid attributes
     Failure/Error: expect(page).to have_content "Could not create book"
       expected to find text "Could not create book" in "New book\nTitle\nAuthor\nCreate"
     # ./spec/features/books/create_spec.rb:19:in `block (2 levels) in <top (required)>'

2 examples, 2 failures
```

The form submission appears to be proceeding, and now we need to handle what happens afterwards.

Our plan here is to use flash messages for displaying the the notices about successful or failed book creation. To support these, we first need to enable cookie sessions for our app. To do this, add this to `config/app.rb`:

```ruby
# config/app.rb

module Bookshelf
  class App < Hanami::App
    config.actions.sessions = :cookie, {
      key: "bookshelf.session",
      secret: settings.session_secret,
      expire_after: 60*60*24*365
    }
  end
end
```

Then add a `session_secret` to your app's settings:

```ruby
# config/settings.rb

module Bookshelf
  class Settings < Hanami::Settings
    setting :session_secret, constructor: Types::String
  end
end
```

And add a dummy secret to your `.env`:

```
SESSION_SECRET=__local_development_secret_only__
```

<p class="notice">
  See <a href="/v2.2/app/settings/#using-dotenv-to-manage-environment-variables">Using dotenv to manage environment variables</a> for recommendations on handling these files.
</p>

Next we can update the app layout to show the flash messages, if there are any:

```sql
<!-- app/templates/layouts/app.html.erb -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Bookshelf</title>
    <%= favicon_tag %>
    <%= stylesheet_tag "app" %>
  </head>
  <body>
    <% if flash[:alert] %>
      <p><%= flash[:alert] %></p>
    <% end %>
    <% if flash[:notice] %>
      <p><%= flash[:notice] %></p>
    <% end %>

    <%= yield %>
    <%= javascript_tag "app" %>
  </body>
</html>
```

To complete our create action, we can add a method to our book repo to create new books:

```ruby
# app/repos/book_repo.rb

module Bookshelf
  module Repos
    class BookRepo < Bookshelf::Repo
      def create(attributes)
        books.changeset(:create, attributes).commit
      end
    end
  end
end
```

In the action, we can then create this book if the posted params are valid, then setting flash messages and redirecting as required:

```ruby
# app/actions/books/create.rb

module Bookshelf
  module Actions
    module Books
      class Create < Bookshelf::Action
        include Deps["repos.book_repo"]

        params do
          required(:book).hash do
            required(:title).filled(:string)
            required(:author).filled(:string)
          end
        end

        def handle(request, response)
          if request.params.valid?
            book = book_repo.create(request.params[:book])

            response.flash[:notice] = "Book created"
            response.redirect_to routes.path(:show_book, id: book[:id])
          else
            response.flash.now[:alert] = "Could not create book"
            # Implicitly re-renders the "new" view
          end
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

And our feature spec now passes!

```shell
$ bundle exec rspec spec/features/books/create_spec.rb

Creating books
  shows errors and does not create the book when given invalid attributes
  creates a book when given valid attributes

2 examples, 0 failures
```

## What's next

So far we've seen how to create a new Hanami app, explored some of the basics of how an app is structured, and seen how we can list, display and create a simple book entity while validating user input.

Still, we've barely touched the surface of what Hanami offers.

From here you might want to look in more detail at [routing](/v2.2/routing/overview/) and [actions](/v2.2/actions/overview/), or explore Hanami's [app architecture](/v2.2/app/container-and-components/), starting with its [component management](/v2.2/app/container-and-components/) and [dependency injection](/v2.2/app/container-and-components/) systems. Or you may want to head straight to the front end and learn more about Hanami's [views](/v2.2/views/overview/) and [assets management](/v2.2/assets/overview/)
