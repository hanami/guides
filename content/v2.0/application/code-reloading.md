Hanami offers fast code reloading in development via the [hanami-reloader](https://github.com/hanami/reloader) gem.

When you run `hanami server` in development, `guard` watches the file system for code edits and restarts the Hanami server when changes occur.

Which directories are watched can be configured in the `Guardfile` of your project.

```ruby
# Guardfile

# frozen_string_literal: true

group :server do
  guard "puma", port: ENV["HANAMI_PORT"] || 2300 do
    watch(%r{config/*})
    watch(%r{lib/*})
    watch(%r{app/*})
    watch(%r{slices/*})
  end
end
```

Hanami takes an "outside the framework" approach to code reloading. This has several advantages:

- file system watching is delegated to `guard`.
- Hanami internals are free from code reloading awareness.
- if the hanami-reloader gem is not present (which is true in production), code reloading logic is eliminated.

Thanks to [Zeitwerk](/v2.0/application/autoloading/) and [lazy loading](/v2.0/application/booting/), code reloading is also very fast.

### Reloading in the console

If you have an existing console session and make a code change, you can use your updated code via the `reload` helper:

```ruby
bundle exec hanami console

bookshelf[development]> reload
Reloading...
```
