Hanami V2.0 does not yet have an "official" implementation of views as did V1.3. This is planned for Hanami V2.1. 
Hanami V2.0 is well-suited for JSON APIs or manual templating with the engine of your choice through [manually setting
`response.body`](/v2.0/actions/request-and-response/#response) in actions in the meantime.
