Hanami 2.0 does not yet include integrated view rendering. This is planned for the upcoming 2.1 release.

In the meantime, Hanami 2.0 is well suited for JSON APIs or manual templating with the view engine of your choice through [manually setting `response.body`](/v2.0/actions/request-and-response/#response) in actions.
