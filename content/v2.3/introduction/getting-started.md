  Hello. If you're reading this page, it's likely you want to learn more about Hanami. This is great, and we're excited to have you here!
  <br><br>
  If you're looking for new ways to build maintainable, secure, faster and testable Ruby apps, you're in for a treat. <strong>Hanami is built for people like you.</strong>
  <br><br>
  Whether you're a total beginner or an experienced developer, <strong>this learning process may still be hard</strong>. Over time, we become used to certain things, and it can be painful to change. <strong>But without change, there is no challenge</strong> and without challenge, there is no growth.
  <br><br>
  In this guide we'll set up our first Hanami project and build a simple web app. We'll touch on all the major components of the Hanami framework, guided by tests at each stage.
  <br><br>
  <strong>If you feel alone or frustrated, don't give up, jump into our <a href="https://discourse.hanamirb.org">forum</a> and ask for help.</strong> We and the rest of our community are putting in our best efforts to make Hanami better every day.

## Getting started

Hanami is a Ruby framework designed to create software that is well-architected, maintainable and a pleasure to work on.

These guides aim to introduce you to the Hanami framework and demonstrate how its components fit together to produce a coherent app.

Ideally, you already have some familiarity with web apps and the [Ruby language](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/).


## Creating a Hanami app

### Prerequisites

To create a Hanami app, you will need Ruby 3.1 or greater. Check your ruby version:

```shell
$ ruby --version
```

If you need to install or upgrade Ruby, follow the instructions on [ruby-lang.org](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/).

You also need Node.js installed, for front end assets. To confirm this, check that `npm` is available:

```shell
$ npm --version
```

If you need to install or upgrade Node.js, follow the instructions on [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

### Installing the gem

In order to create a Hanami app, first install the hanami gem:

```shell
$ gem install hanami
```

### Using the app generator

Hanami provides a `hanami new` command for generating a new app.

Let's use it to create a new app for managing books called **bookshelf**:

```shell
$ hanami new bookshelf
```

Running this command has created a new `bookshelf` directory in our current location. Here's what it contains:

```shell
$ cd bookshelf
$ tree --gitignore --filesfirst .

27 directories, 41 files
```

Here's how these files and directories are used:

| Location               | Purpose                                      |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Gemfile | The app's gem dependencies, installed using bundler.                   |
| Guardfile | Supports code reloading in development. |
| Procfile.dev | For running Hanami dev server processes: both the server and assets watcher. |
| package.json | The app's Node.js package dependencies, for assets management, installed using npm. |
| README.md | The app's README document. |
| Rakefile | Support for running Rake tasks. |
| app/ | This is the directory where you'll put the majority of your app's code. |
| config/ | A directory for your app and assets configuration, also including things like routes, settings and Puma configuration. |
| config.ru | The Rack config file. |
| lib/ | A directory for supporting code. |
| spec/ | The app's RSpec test suite. |

We'll see this structure in more detail as this guide progresses.

For now let's get our new app running. In the bookshelf directory, run:

```shell
$ bundle exec hanami dev
```

If all has gone well, you should see output similar to:

```shell
08:14:33 web.1    | started with pid 56242
08:14:33 assets.1 | started with pid 56243

08:14:35 web.1    | Use Ctrl-C to stop
```

Visit your app in the browser at [http://localhost:2300](http://localhost:2300)

```shell
$ open http://localhost:2300
```

You should see the Hanami welcome screen. We're delighted to have you here!

## Building a Hanami app

It's time to get started building your app. Your next steps here will be based on the kind of app you want to build:
